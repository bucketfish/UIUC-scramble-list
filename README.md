# UIUC-scramble-list
A collection of sites on which your UIUC NetID password will be scrambled if you visit with a non-school VPN. [list.txt](/list.txt)

# Why is this created?
Oh my god I have been password scrambled and had to change it for a million times, yet I still triggers it every single day (well not like that often but you get it).

And, I found I am *not the only one* who has this problem.b So I created a collection of the websites on which using a proxy may trigger the system to scramble your password so you can import it into your proxy software to route them to direct connect or something similar.

# How to use it?
Simply open the [list.txt](/list.txt) and set the urls as a rule for direct connection in your proxy  or VPN software.
